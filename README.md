# Empriser

> *emprise* - an adventurous, daring, or chivalric enterprise

Empriser generates world maps, intended to be used in pen-and-paper role-playing games ([D&D](http://dnd.wizards.com/), [pathfinder](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG), etc…).

Rather than editing the map directly, you specicfy various parameters
(temperature, terrain smoothness, percent mountains, percent water, etc…) and
Empriser will create the map for you.
