# Empriser

> *emprise* - an adventurous, daring, or chivalric enterprise

Empriser generates world maps, intended to be used in pen-and-paper role-playing games ([D&D](http://dnd.wizards.com/), [pathfinder](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG), etc…).

Rather than editing the map directly, you specicfy various parameters (temperature, terrain smoothness, percent mountains, percent water, etc…) and Empriser will create the map for you.

# Status

Map generation is fully functional, but in its infancy. 

## Things you can do:
* Create maps
* Save and load maps files
* Save as image: just right click the map

## Limitations
* there are no legends - you have to infer the meaning of the color codes on the map
* Navigation is slow
* Still kind of ugly looking

## Current Plans

* Optimize map display (via [PIXI.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js))
* Improve map appearances (more realistic looking maps)
* Add legends and mouseover (to know what each tile represents)

There are many more plans ahead, these are just the up-and-coming changes.
