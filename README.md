# Empriser

> *emprise* - an adventurous, daring, or chivalric enterprise

Empriser generates world maps, intended to be used in pen-and-paper role-playing games ([D&D](http://dnd.wizards.com/), [pathfinder](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG), etc…).

Rather than editing the map directly, you specicfy various parameters
(temperature, terrain smoothness, percent mountains, percent water, etc…) and
Empriser will create the map for you.

# Usage

# Status

You can create and explore simple maps. 

## Things you can do:
* Create maps
* Save and load maps files
* Save as image: just right click the map

## Limitations

* Currently vegetation has no effect on the map visualization.

## Current Plans

* Add legends and mouseover (to know what each tile represents)
* Adjustable continent size
* Generate rivers
* Wind simulation
* Visualize vegetation OR remove vegetation options.

There are many more plans ahead, these are just the up-and-coming changes.
